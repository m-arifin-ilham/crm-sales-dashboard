# ✨CRM Sales Dashboard✨
An interactive dashboard report for dummy Sales Managers to track teams' quarterly performance using Google Sheets. The report can be used by the leadership team to analyze quarterly trends and sales agent performance. The report consists of pivot tables of total opportunities. There is also a dashboard showing a scorecard chart of total opportunities won in recent quarter compared to the previous one, pie chart of percentage of deals won and lost and bar chart of opportunities won by sales agent for the most recent quarter with slicer for regional office and manager field.

The report can be accessed in the file "CRM Sales Dashboard.xlsx". It is also available at (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16V5iDqFNy3U2xj6dA5wpDiPKhyJrFv9os7tXgU10N-0/edit?usp=sharing). Also, the data I used can be accessed in the folder "CRM Sales Opportunities", in which, you can find the "_sales_pipeline.csv_" and "_sales_teams.csv_" data necessary for the dashboard. Additional information about the data itself and the fields is provided in the file "_data_dictionary.csv_". The file "_products.csv_" and "_accounts.csv_" are additional data that can be used to improve the dashboard, which I plan to do. You can see the most updated dashboard at the sheets link. 

Any suggestions for improvement will be greatly appreciated. Thank you

Note: The data and the project comes from MavenAnalytics. I thanked them for their project walkthrough.
